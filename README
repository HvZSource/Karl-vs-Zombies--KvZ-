Install:
   When installing this system, the name of the subdomain is the same as the database prefix.

Please follow these steps:
   Upload files to server
   Set Permissions (chmod -R 777 pics admin/twitter_conf.txt)
   Set Admin Registration Password (in the file settings/config.dat)
   Create Database and Users
   Set Database Cradentials (in the file settings/config.dat)

To create a game you need to 
   Create a subdomain and point to the instal directory.
   Create a directory in the pics/ folder with the same name as the subdomain
   Make sure that the permissions are 777 (writable to everyone!) 
   Change the "subdomain-name" on in DB.sql with your actual subdmain's name
   Import DB.sql to your databse 

All configurations (time zone/ twitter/ edit rules / front page/ edit players) take place in the admin section (ex. http://yoursite.com/admin).
